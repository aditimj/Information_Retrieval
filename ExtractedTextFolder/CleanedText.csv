0,Anxiety Disorders  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,What Are the Kinds of Anxiety Disorders?,"Different anxiety disorders can affect kids and teens. They include:  generalized anxiety disorder  separation anxiety disorder  social anxiety disorder  panic disorder  selective mutism  specific phobias  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD causes kids to worry almost every day — and over lots of things. Kids with GAD worry over things that most kids worry about, like homework, tests, or making mistakes.  But with GAD, kids worry more, and more often, about these things. Kids with GAD also worry over things parents might not expect would cause worry. For example, they might worry about recess, lunchtime, birthday parties, playtime with friends, or riding the school bus. Kids with GAD may also worry about war, weather, or the future. Or about loved ones, safety, illness, or getting hurt.  Having GAD can make it hard for kids to focus in school. Because with GAD, there is almost always a worry on a kid's mind. GAD makes it hard for kids to relax and have fun, eat well, or fall asleep at night. They may miss many days of school because worry makes them feel sick, afraid, or tired.  Some kids with GAD keep worries to themselves. Others talk about their worries with a parent or teacher. They might ask over and over whether something they worry about will happen. But it's hard for them to feel OK, no matter what a parent says.    Separation anxiety disorder (SAD). It's normal for babies and very young kids to feel anxious the first times they are apart from their parent. But soon they get used to being with a grandparent, babysitter, or teacher. And they start to feel at home at daycare or school.  But when kids don't outgrow the fear of being apart from a parent, it's called separation anxiety disorder. Even as they get older, kids with SAD feel very anxious about being away from their parent or away from home. They may miss many days of school. They may say they feel too sick or upset to go. They may cling to a parent, cry, or refuse to go to school, sleepovers, playdates, or other activities without their parent. At home, they may have trouble falling asleep or sleeping alone. They may avoid being in a room at home if their parent isn't close by.  Social phobia (social anxiety disorder). With social phobia, kids to feel too afraid of what others will think or say. They are always afraid they might do or say something embarrassing. They worry they might sound or look weird. They don't like to be the center of attention. They don't want others to notice them, so they might avoid raising their hand in class. If they get called on in class, they may freeze or panic and can't answer. With social phobia, a class presentation or a group activity with classmates can cause extreme fear.  Social phobia can cause kids and teens to avoid school or friends. They may feel sick or tired before or during school. They may complain of other body sensations that go with anxiety too. For example, they may feel their heart racing or feel short of breath. They may feel jumpy and feel they can't sit still. They may feel their face get hot or blush. They may feel shaky or lightheaded.  Panic disorder. These sudden anxiety attacks can cause overwhelming physicals symptoms, such as feeling shaky or jittery, trembling, a racing heart rate, and shortness of breath. Panic attacks can happen any time. They’re more common in teens than kids.  Selective mutism. This extreme form of social phobia causes kids to be so afraid they don't talk. Kids and teens who have it can talk. And they do talk at home or with their closest people. But they refuse to talk at all at school, with friends, or in other places where they have this fear.  Specific phobias. It's normal for young kids to feel scared of the dark, monsters, big animals, or loud noises like thunder or fireworks. Most of the time, when kids feel afraid, adults can help them feel safe and calm again. But a phobia is a more intense, more extreme, and longer lasting fear of a specific thing. With a phobia, a child dreads the thing they fear and tries to avoid it. If they are near what they fear, they feel terrified and are hard to comfort.  With a specific phobia, kids may have an extreme fear of things like animals, spiders, needles or shots, blood, throwing up, thunderstorms, people in costumes, or the dark. A phobia causes kids to avoid going places where they think they might see the thing they fear. For example, a kid with a phobia of dogs may not go to a friend's house, to a park, or to a party because dogs might be there.","https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/anxiety-disorders.html#catfeelings

It can make them feel afraid, worried, or nervous.  It can affect their body too. They might feel shaky, jittery, or short of breath. They may feel ""butterflies"" in their stomach, a hot face, clammy hands, dry mouth, or a racing heart.  These symptoms of anxiety are the result of the ""fight or flight"" response. This is the body's normal response to danger. It triggers the release of natural chemicals in the body. These chemicals prepare us to deal with a real danger. They affect heart rate, breathing, muscles, nerves, and digestion. This response is meant to protect us from danger. But with anxiety disorders, the ""fight or flight"" response is overactive.

Genes help direct the way brain chemicals (called neurotransmitters) work. If specific brain chemicals are in short supply, or not working well, it can cause anxiety.  Life situations.

In CBT:  Parents learn how to best respond when a child is anxious. They learn how to help kids face fears.  Kids learn coping skills so they can face fear and worry less.  The therapist helps kids practice, and gives support and praise as they try. Over time, kids learn to face fears and feel better. They learn to get used to situations they're afraid of.

 What Is Traumatic Stress? 
 This is the stress that comes with trauma events that are serious, intense, or sudden. Traumas such as serious accidents or injuries, abuse, or violence can prompt this type of stress.  Parents can step in to protect kids when they know they are being mistreated or bullied. But it’s not always possible to protect kids from every type of trauma. If kids and teens go through traumatic stress, parents can help them get the care they need to recover.  What parents can do:  Give kids and teens extra support and care. Be there to listen and talk. Let kids know that they are safe. Validate and accept their feelings. Let them know that, with time, they will feel better.  Reach out to your child’s doctor or a therapist. Some need therapy to heal from traumatic stress. Parents can take part in the therapy and learn how to best help their child.  Spend positive time together. Encourage kids and teens to do things they enjoy. These might be things you can do together or things your teen does on their own, like enjoying music, nature, or art. These things prompt positive emotions that can offset some of the stress left over from trauma.  Give kids and teens a chance to use their strengths in everyday life.

41,Helping Kids Deal With Bullies  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,Building Confidence,"Parents can help kids learn how to deal with bullying if it happens. For some parents, it may be tempting to tell a kid to fight back. After all, you're angry that your child is suffering and maybe you were told to ""stand up for yourself"" when you were young. Or you may worry that your child will continue to be bullied, and think that fighting back is the only way to put a bully in their place.  But it's important to advise kids not to respond to bullying by fighting or bullying back. It can quickly escalate into violence, trouble, and someone getting injured. Instead, it's best to walk away from the situation, hang out with others, and tell an adult.  Here are some other ways kids can improve the situation and feel better:  Avoid the bully and use the buddy system. Use a different bathroom if a bully is nearby and don't go to your locker if nobody else is around. Make sure you have someone with you so that you're not alone with the bully. Buddy up with a friend on the bus, in the hallways, or at recess — wherever the bully is. Offer to do the same for a friend.  Hold the anger. It's natural to get upset by the bully, but that's what bullies thrive on. It makes them feel more powerful. Practice not reacting by crying or looking red or upset. It takes a lot of practice, but it's a useful skill for keeping off of a bully's radar. Sometimes kids find it useful to practice ""cool down"" strategies such as counting to 10, writing down their angry words, taking deep breaths, or walking away. Sometimes the best thing to do is to teach kids to keep their face calm until they are clear of any danger (smiling or laughing may provoke the bully).  Act brave, walk away, and ignore the bully. Firmly and clearly tell the bully to stop, then walk away. Practice ways to ignore the hurtful remarks, like acting uninterested or texting someone on your cellphone. By ignoring the bully, you're showing that you don't care. Eventually, the bully will probably get bored with trying to bother you.  Tell an adult. Teachers, principals, parents, and lunchroom personnel at school can all help stop bullying.  Talk about it. Talk to someone you trust, such as a guidance counselor, teacher, sibling, or friend. They may offer some helpful suggestions.

48,Strategies Parents and Kids Can Use to Help Prevent Bullying,Strategies Parents and Kids Can Use to Help Prevent Bullying,"This might be the least discussed but clearly the most effective way to eliminate bullying from our kids’ lives. If every kid knew not to be a bully, there wouldn’t be a need to stand up for bullied kids. Again, with the undying hopes! Here’s my approach to this issue for my kids. First, we know that many kids are bullied or made to feel powerless in their own lives before they ever become bullies themselves. So, we try to avoid arbitrary exertions of parental power – good rules have reasons – and we try to emphasize good character at least as much as we do childhood accomplishments. An act of kindness or sympathy is noted and praised as much as a great report card or a home run. We talk a lot about boundaries – about how everyone gets to make decisions about their bodies ranging from the right not to be hit or kicked to the right to choose not to give a hug or be tickled. We try to teach that we are better for our differences than if we were all exactly alike. And we try to help our kids imagine themselves in someone else’s shoes (“How do you think you would feel if…?”). Most importantly, we try to role model kindness and respect in our own lives and words. We know that our example speaks louder to them than anything we say.  There is a lot of other information out there and from people far more qualified than me to give advice.

 Strategies Parents and Kids Can Use to Help Prevent Bullying 
 This might be the least discussed but clearly the most effective way to eliminate bullying from our kids’ lives. If every kid knew not to be a bully, there wouldn’t be a need to stand up for bullied kids. Again, with the undying hopes! Here’s my approach to this issue for my kids. First, we know that many kids are bullied or made to feel powerless in their own lives before they ever become bullies themselves. So, we try to avoid arbitrary exertions of parental power – good rules have reasons – and we try to emphasize good character at least as much as we do childhood accomplishments. An act of kindness or sympathy is noted and praised as much as a great report card or a home run. We talk a lot about boundaries – about how everyone gets to make decisions about their bodies ranging from the right not to be hit or kicked to the right to choose not to give a hug or be tickled. We try to teach that we are better for our differences than if we were all exactly alike. And we try to help our kids imagine themselves in someone else’s shoes (“How do you think you would feel if…?”). Most importantly, we try to role model kindness and respect in our own lives and words. We know that our example speaks louder to them than anything we say.  There is a lot of other information out there and from people far more qualified than me to give advice. My hope today is to re-emphasize how important this issue is and give you a starting point for dealing with it for your kids.

53,Stuttering  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,What Are the Signs of Stuttering?,"The first signs of stuttering tend to appear when a child is about 18–24 months old. At this age, there's a burst in vocabulary and kids are starting to put words together to form sentences. To parents, the stuttering may be upsetting and frustrating, but it is natural for kids to do some stuttering at this stage. Be as patient with your child as possible.  A child may stutter for a few weeks or several months, and the stuttering may come and go. Most kids who begin stuttering before the age of 5 stop without any need for help such as speech or language therapy.  But if your child's stuttering happens a lot, gets worse, or happens along with body or facial movements, seeing a speech-language therapist around age 3 is a good idea.  Usually, stuttering lets up when kids enter elementary school and start sharpening their communication skills. A school-age child who continues to stutter is likely aware of the problem and may be embarrassed by it. Classmates and friends may draw attention to it or even tease the child.  If this happens with your child, talk to the teacher, who can address this in the classroom with the kids. The teacher also might decrease the number of stressful speaking situations for your child until speech therapy begins.",https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/stutter.html#catbehavio,"Stuttering  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth

 Tearful, tantrum-filled goodbyes are common during a child's earliest years. Around the first birthday, many kids develop separation anxiety, getting upset when a parent tries to leave them with someone else.

70,Separation Anxiety  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,How Long Does It Last?,"Babies adapt pretty well to other caregivers. Parents probably feel more anxiety about being separated than infants do! As long as their needs are being met, most babies younger than 6 months adjust easily to other people.  Between 4-7 months of age, babies develop a sense of ""object permanence."" They're realizing that things and people exist even when they're out of sight. Babies learn that when they can't see mom or dad, that means they've gone away. They don't understand the concept of time, so they don't know mom will come back, and can become upset by her absence. Whether mom is in the kitchen, in the next bedroom, or at the office, it's all the same to the baby, who might cry until mom is nearby again.  Kids between 8 months and 1 year old are growing into more independent toddlers, yet are even more uncertain about being separated from a parent. This is when separation anxiety develops, and children may become agitated and upset when a parent tries to leave.  Whether you need to go into the next room for just a few seconds, leave your child with a sitter for the evening, or drop off your child at daycare, your child might now react by crying, clinging to you, and resisting attention from others.  The timing of separation anxiety can vary. Some kids might go through it later, between 18 months and 2½ years of age. Some never experience it.

73,Separation Anxiety  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,It's Only Temporary,"These tips can help ease kids and parents through this difficult period:  Timing is everything. Try not to start daycare or childcare with an unfamiliar person when your child is between the ages of 8 months and 1 year, when separation anxiety is first likely to appear. Also, try not to leave when your child is tired, hungry, or restless. If at all possible, schedule your departures for after naps and mealtimes.  Practice. Practice being apart from each other, and introduce new people and places slowly. If you plan to leave your child with a relative or a new babysitter, invite that person over in advance so they can spend time together while you're in the room. If your child is starting at a new daycare center or preschool, make a few visits there together before a full-time schedule begins. Practice leaving your child with a caregiver for short periods so that he or she can get used to being away from you.  Be calm and consistent. Create an exit ritual during which you say a pleasant, loving, and firm goodbye. Stay calm and show confidence in your child. Reassure him or her that you'll be back — and explain when you'll return using concepts kids will understand (such as after lunch). Give your full attention when you say goodbye, and when you say you're leaving, mean it; coming back will only make things worse.  Follow through on promises. It's important to make sure that you return when you have promised to. This is critical — this is how your child will develop the confidence that he or she can make it through the time apart.  As hard as it may be to leave a child who's screaming and crying for you, it's important to have confidence that the caregiver can handle it. By the time you get to your car, your child is likely to have calmed down and be playing with other things.  If you're caring for another person's child who's having separation anxiety, try to distract the child with an activity or toy, or with songs, games, or anything else that's fun. You may have to keep trying until something just clicks with the child.  Also, try not to mention the child's mother or father, but do answer the child's questions in a simple and straightforward way.

77,Toilet Training Your Toddler: Strategy,"Toilet Training Your Toddler: Strategy, Not Tactics","The first step is to assess your child’s readiness for toilet training.  Developmental readiness encompasses the ability to sense the need to pee or poop, the ability to communicate that sensation to a caregiver, the ability to sit steadily on the toilet seat – whether a toddler’s potty chair or modification of the regular toilet – and to devote his or her attention to the task at hand for a sufficient period of time.  Some experts recommend the ability to pull his or her pants up and down, but initially your child will be accompanied to the toilet 100% of the time, and I consider this less necessary than the other requirements.  In addition to this, your child should display interest in using the potty and a desire to be “clean” or be rid of diapers.  Children display interest in a variety of ways, including following parents into the bathroom, asking questions, making observations and reporting when the diaper needs changing.  Even after these signs appear, it may take weeks or months for the child to progress from curiosity to toilet training action, and it is important for the parent to be attuned to the child’s interest and open to his or her questions.  It is helpful for parents to agree on what they consider to be appropriate terminology within the household for these bodily functions and to be consistent in their use in order to avoid creating confusion for the child.  When thinking about your timeline for toilet training, it is important to approach your child as an individual who is just trying to master a task.  There is no evidence that the timing of toilet training has any association with intelligence or future success in life.  My very bright, socially adept son may have been the last in his daycare class to complete toilet training (I’m not actually sure, since I made a conscious decision not to create comparisons), but he was within the same general timeline, completely within reported age norms, and well before he needed to enter the diaper-free zone known as preschool.  Your child will eventually perceive the need to conform to this social expectation, and the process will be completed more quickly and painlessly on his/her timeline than on an imposed one.  There is currently no evidence to support the idea that offering a reward – other than the intrinsic rewards of being “more grown up” and being rid of diapers – will create the necessary motivation to complete toilet training.  Positive reinforcement even for small attempts at progress is encouraged – go ahead and be very liberal with your praise.  Most importantly, discipline or shaming has no place in a successful toilet training process and is more likely to prolong or delay it.  Negative comparisons to other children’s progress should be avoided, and once training is underway, the inevitable accidents should be met with a matter-of-fact change of clothing and an “It’s OK – we’ll get it the next time!”  Frequent accidents are generally an indication that the child is not quite ready, and at that point you should resume the use of diapers until the child expresses interest in trying again.  Remember, too, that nighttime dryness is generally achieved somewhat later than daytime dryness, and your child may require a diaper or “pull up” at night for some time after daytime toilet training is achieved.  In the service of not torturing yourself, it is fully acceptable to avoid toilet training methods that you feel will only aggravate you.  Other parents have told me that they used the often-touted method of allowing their child to run around the house completely in the nude for a weekend, whisking him or her off to the toilet whenever it appeared that he or she needed to go or had commenced going.  This worked for them, and kudos to them.  The neat freak in me cannot even contemplate this slightly feral situation without horror, and I quickly eliminated it from the list of tools I might consider.  Likewise, my children have shown more interest in the actual potty than in the potty chair, and I am more than happy not to have an Elmo-shaped chamber pot to empty and clean.  Providing timed “opportunities” for success did make sense to me, however, and I frequently offered a trial of sitting on the potty around bath time and before bedtime.  It may take some trial and error, but with patience and an intact sense of humor, you will find what works for you and your child.",https://childrensmd.org/browse-by-topic/behavior-development/toilet-training-your-toddler-strategy-not-tactics,"Toilet Training Your Toddler: Strategy

96,Nightmares  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,What Causes Nightmares?,"Nightmares — like most dreams — happen during the stage of sleep when the brain is very active. The vivid images the brain is processing can seem as real as the emotions they might trigger.  This part of sleep is known as the rapid eye movement or REM stage because the eyes are rapidly moving beneath closed eyelids. Nightmares tend to happen during the second half of a night's sleep, when REM periods are longer.  When kids awaken from a nightmare, its images are still fresh and can seem real. So it's natural for them to feel afraid and upset and to call out to a parent for comfort.  By about preschool age, kids begin to understand that a nightmare is only a dream — and that what's happening isn't real and can't hurt them.

 What Causes Nightmares? 
 Nightmares — like most dreams — happen during the stage of sleep when the brain is very active. The vivid images the brain is processing can seem as real as the emotions they might trigger.  This part of sleep is known as the rapid eye movement or REM stage because the eyes are rapidly moving beneath closed eyelids. Nightmares tend to happen during the second half of a night's sleep, when REM periods are longer.  When kids awaken from a nightmare, its images are still fresh and can seem real. So it's natural for them to feel afraid and upset and to call out to a parent for comfort.  By about preschool age, kids begin to understand that a nightmare is only a dream — and that what's happening isn't real and can't hurt them. But knowing that doesn't prevent them from feeling scared. Even older kids feel frightened when they awaken from a nightmare."

For boys who feel awkward — or scared — about standing on a stool to pee in the toilet, a potty chair may be a better option.  You may want to get a training potty or seat for every bathroom in your house. You may even want to keep a potty in the trunk of your car for emergencies. When traveling long distances, be sure to take a potty seat with you and stop every 1 to 2 hours. Otherwise, it can take too long to find a restroom."
114,Toilet Training  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,About Training Pants,"Disposable training pants are a helpful step between diapers and underwear. Because kids' nighttime bladder and bowel control often lags behind their daytime control, some parents like using training pants at night.

115,Toilet Training  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,Tips for Toilet Training,"Even before your child is ready to try the potty, you can prepare your little one by teaching about the process:  Use words to express the act of using the toilet (""pee,"" ""poop,"" and ""potty"").  Ask your child to let you know when a diaper is wet or soiled.  Identify behaviors (""Are you going poop?"") so that your child can learn to recognize the urge to pee and poop.  Get a potty chair your child can practice sitting on. At first, your child can sit on it wearing clothes or a diaper. When ready, your child can go bare-bottomed.  If you've decided that your child is ready to start learning how to use the potty, these tips may help:  Set aside some time to devote to the potty-training process.  Don't make your child sit on the toilet against his or her will.  Show your child how you sit on the toilet and explain what you're doing (because your child learns by watching you). You also can have your child sit on the potty seat and watch while you (or a sibling) use the toilet.  Establish a routine. For example, you may want to begin by having your child sit on the potty after waking with a dry diaper, or 45 minutes to an hour after drinking lots of liquids. Only put your child on the potty for a few minutes a couple of times a day, and let your child get up if he or she wants to.  Have your child sit on the potty within 15 to 30 minutes after meals to take advantage of the body's natural tendency to have a bowel movement after eating (this is called the gastro-colic reflex). Also, many kids have a time of day they tend to have a bowel movement.  Ask your child to sit on the potty if you see clear clues of needing to go to the bathroom, such as crossing legs, grunting, or squatting.  Empty a bowel movement (poop) from your child's diaper into the toilet, and tell your child that poop goes in the potty.  Avoid clothes that are hard to take off, such as overalls and shirts that snap in the crotch. Kids who are potty training need to be able to undress themselves.  Offer your child small rewards, such as stickers or time reading, every time your child goes in the potty. Keep a chart to track of successes. Once your little one appears to be mastering the use of the toilet, let him or her pick out a few new pairs of big-kid underwear to wear.  Make sure all caregivers — including babysitters, grandparents, and childcare workers — follow the same routine and use the same names for body parts and bathroom acts. Let them know how you're handling toilet training and ask that they use the same approaches so your child won't be confused.  Praise all attempts to use the toilet, even if nothing happens. And remember that accidents will happen. It's important not to punish potty-training children or show disappointment when they wet or soil themselves or the bed. Instead, tell your child that it was an accident and offer your support. Reassure your child that he or she is well on the way to using the potty like a big kid.",https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/toilet-teaching.html#catbehavio,"Toilet Training  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth

119,Tips for Divorcing Parents  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,Encourage kids to share their feelings — positive or negative — about what's happening.,"It's important for divorcing — and already divorced — parents to sit down with their kids and encourage them to say what they're thinking and feeling. But keep this separate from your own feelings. Assure your kids that their feelings are important, valid, and normal. Let them know that you can handle a conversation about even difficult or painful feelings.  During these conversations, avoid problem solving and trying to change the way a child feels. Instead focus on listening and thanking kids for their honesty. Most often, kids feel a loss of family and may blame you or the other parent — or both — for what's going on in their lives. So, you'll need to be ready to answer questions your kids might raise or to address their concerns.  Make talking about the divorce and how it's affecting your kids an ongoing process. As they get older and become more mature, kids might have questions or concerns that they hadn't thought of earlier. Even if it seems like you've gone over the same topics before, keep the dialogue open. If possible, sit down with the other parent and plan how you're going to talk about what's going on.  If you feel like you may get too upset, ask someone else (a relative, maybe) to talk to your kids. It's OK and healthy for kids to see their parents feel sad or upset, but getting very emotional can make them feel responsible for their parents' feelings.  If your children do see you struggle with a difficult emotion, model healthy coping as much as possible. Try to:  Label your emotion for them (""I'm feeling sad right now."">).  State that you know it's OK to feel this way sometimes (It's OK and normal for me to feel sad"").  Talk about how you'll cope with your tough feelings (""Something that always helps me feel better when I'm sad is baking cookies with you or playing outside. Let's go do it!"").  It's natural for kids to have many emotions about a divorce. They might feel guilty and imagine that they ""caused"" the problem. This is particularly true if kids overheard their parents arguing about them. Kids and teens may feel angry or frightened, or worried about their future. If they voice these emotions, reassure them that this was not the case while reminding them that it's a normal feeling.  Although kids may struggle with a divorce for quite a while, the real impact is usually felt over about a 2- to 3-year period. During this time, some can voice their feelings. But, depending on their age and development, other kids just won't have the words. They may instead act out or be depressed. For school-age kids, this might mean their grades drop or they lose interest in activities. For younger children, these feelings are often expressed during play too. Be aware of a ""sleeper effect"" with young children: they might take big changes in stride at first, but disruptive behaviors or challenging emotions can come up years later. Communicating openly with kids and modeling healthy coping, even if they seem OK with the big changes, can reduce trouble down the road.  It may be tempting to tell a child not to feel a certain way, but kids (and adults, for that matter) have a right to their feelings. And if you try to force a ""happy face,"" your kids may be less likely to share their true feelings with you.  Group programs for kids of divorce run by schools or faith-based organizations are an excellent resource for kids and families who need some help to get through these early stages.",https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/divorce.html#catfeeling,"Tips for Divorcing Parents  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth

125,How to Build Your Child's Confidence and Self-Esteem - Child Development Institute,About The Author," Self-esteem plays a significant role in the development of healthy children. A recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology suggests that a child’s self-esteem is already established by age five and is comparable in strength to that of adults. Children with high self-esteem generally become more successful in life.   Unfortunately, the outcomes for children with low self-esteem can be quite poor. As a parent, your child’s self-esteem is primarily your responsibility. You can do a lot to help your child feel confident and competent.   Children with high self-esteem have the confidence to try new activities and feel a sense of pride in their accomplishments. While it’s never pleasant to fail, these kids possess the emotional ability to withstand the lack of success and maintain the courage to try again. Children with low self-esteem are self-critical and have difficulty being positive when making mistakes, which may make them unable to try again or refuse the next opportunity to succeed.  Children can be sensitive and have a peer group that can be harsh, so as a parent, what you do at home matters tremendously. Your child’s healthy self-esteem will also serve as a buffer to survive the unpleasantness of other kids.   Give your child the best chance to thrive and be happy. Use the following strategies to help them feel good about themselves:   1. Love your child unconditionally. Every child should believe that no matter what they do—success or failure—their parents still love them and will continue to be there for them. Consider the impact on a child’s self-esteem when they believe they’re only loved when they behave a certain way or achieve a specific result.   2. Spend quality time. Spending one-on-one time with your kids has more to do with ordinary daily life than what you might initially expect. It’s simple and meaningful interactions, such as bedtime stories and family dinners, that are essential for your child’s development and future relationships. Try to carve out time to connect with your child daily.  3. Help to set achievable goals. Few things are more beneficial to self-esteem than success. Work with your child to establish these goals. Begin with goals that are easy to accomplish to provide them with a taste of success and the confidence boost that goes along with it. For example, an achievable goal for a young child might be to pick up their toys and put them away.  4. Encourage persistence. Success and persistence go hand-in-hand. Encourage your child to be persistent, and you are showing them how to be successful. Praise them when they stick to a difficult task and don’t give up. One way you can help your kids is to set a good example. Demonstrate what it means to persevere and to have a positive attitude.   5. Give your child choices.When you don’t have control over your life, it’s hard to have self-esteem. Give your child choices to provide a sense of self-control and encourage their ability to trust their own judgment. This can be as simple as giving them two options for lunch or choosing what outfit they wear to school, even if it’s a little mismatched.  6. Discourage perfection. Discourage your child from attempting to be perfect—a game no one can win. Your child’s self-esteem will suffer when they realize they can never be perfect. Show them that you value effort and progress. These are actions that anyone can achieve.  7. Avoid over-praising. Your child knows when your praise is excessive. In fact, excessive praise has been shown over time to hurt a child’s confidence rather than boost it. Give credit when recognition is due. Praise your child for making a reasonable effort, and be as specific as possible versus speaking in general terms. For example, instead of saying, “That painting looks beautiful!” say something like, “I love the way you used so many different colors!”  8. Allow your child to overhear you complimenting them. A child gets a significant boost in their self-esteem when they hear a parent praising them to another adult. Your kids are always watching you. Use that to your advantage whenever possible.  9. Take good care of yourself. Taking proper care of yourself shows your kids that you’re important and value yourself. They will believe they’re important and should also take care of themselves. You can model to your child how to make themselves a priority.  There’s no doubt that a child with high self-esteem is happier and more confident. We want the best for our children, so our responsibility is to help lead them down this path.  What we do at home can significantly impact our children’s future. Teach your children to love, value, and believe in themselves, and they’ll reap the benefits throughout their lives.",https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/parenting/how-to-build-your-childs-confidence-and-self-esteem,"How to Build Your Child's Confidence and Self-Esteem - Child Development Institute

This can be as simple as giving them two options for lunch or choosing what outfit they wear to school, even if it’s a little mismatched.  6. Discourage perfection. Discourage your child from attempting to be perfect—a game no one can win. Your child’s self-esteem will suffer when they realize they can never be perfect. Show them that you value effort and progress. These are actions that anyone can achieve.  7. Avoid over-praising. Your child knows when your praise is excessive. In fact, excessive praise has been shown over time to hurt a child’s confidence rather than boost it. Give credit when recognition is due. Praise your child for making a reasonable effort, and be as specific as possible versus speaking in general terms. For example, instead of saying, “That painting looks beautiful!” say something like, “I love the way you used so many different colors!”  8. Allow your child to overhear you complimenting them. A child gets a significant boost in their self-esteem when they hear a parent praising them to another adult. Your kids are always watching you. Use that to your advantage whenever possible.  9. Take good care of yourself. Taking proper care of yourself shows your kids that you’re important and value yourself. They will believe they’re important and should also take care of themselves. You can model to your child how to make themselves a priority.  There’s no doubt that a child with high self-esteem is happier and more confident. We want the best for our children, so our responsibility is to help lead them down this path.  What we do at home can significantly impact our children’s future. Teach your children to love, value, and believe in themselves, and they’ll reap the benefits throughout their lives."

130,Biting  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,When Should I Call the Doctor?,"Parents should have a zero-tolerance rule for biting — at home, daycare, and elsewhere. If it does happen, be sure to deal with it right away.  The next time your child bites, try these steps:  Step 1: Be calm and firm. Address your child with a firm ""no biting!"" or ""biting hurts!"" Keep it simple and easy for a toddler to understand. Make it clear that biting is wrong, but avoid lengthy explanations until your child is old enough to understand. Remaining as calm as possible will help resolve the situation more quickly.  Step 2: Comfort the victim. Direct your attention to the person who has been bitten, especially if it's another child. If there is an injury, clean the area with soap and water. Get medical care if the bite is deep or bleeding.  Step 3: Comfort the biter, if need be. Often, toddlers don't realize that biting hurts. It's OK to comfort a child who feels upset about hurting someone. An older toddler might learn from being allowed to comfort or apologize to a friend after a bite. But if the biter is using the behavior to get attention, you don't want to reinforce this behavior by giving comfort and attention.  Step 4: Offer alternatives. When things have calmed down, suggest alternatives to biting, like using the words ""no,"" ""stop,"" and ""that's mine"" when wanting to communicate with others. For example, show your child how to approach a peer, put out their hand, and then say “please” to ask for an item.  Step 5: Redirect. Distraction works wonders with kids this age. If emotions and energy levels are running high or if boredom has set in, help redirect a little one's attention to a more positive activity, like dancing to music, coloring, or playing a game.  Discipline usually is not necessary, as most kids don't realize biting hurts. Never hit or bite a child who has bitten, as this teaches the child that this behavior is OK.  If you try these steps and the behavior doesn't stop, time-outs may help. Older toddlers can go to a designated time-out area — a kitchen chair or bottom stair — to calm down. As a general rule, about 1 minute per year of age is a good guide for time-outs. You might need to supervise your toddler during a time-out, but be careful to not give them any attention. Your child should be calm and quiet before leaving the time-out area.  To keep your little one on the right track:  Be consistent. Reinforce the ""No biting"" rule at all times.  Use positive reinforcement. Rather than reward negative actions with attention, make it a point to praise your child when they behave well. You can say something like, ""I like how you used your words"" or ""I like how you're playing gently"" to reinforce positive alternatives to biting.  Plan ahead. Toddlers might be more comfortable and not feel the urge to bite if they know what to expect in new or high-energy situations. If biting happens at childcare, you might consider putting your child in a calmer, smaller setting.  Find alternatives. As language skills develop, you can help your child find better ways to express difficult emotions. For example, asking kids to ""use their words"" when they're frustrated or upset can help calm them. If you need help, a doctor, counselor, or behavioral specialist can discuss ways to teach your child to manage strong emotions and express feelings in a healthy way.",https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/stop-biting.html#catbehavio,"Biting  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth

145,Common Time-Out Mistakes and How to Solve Them,  The New and Improved Time-Out Technique  ,"Step 1: Give one clear warning. The best study found that a single non-repetitive warning before every time-out can reduce the number of time-outs needed by 74 percent, says Dr. Larzelere. If your child doesn't start cooperating within five seconds, proceed with the time-out.  Step 2: Announce a time-out. You might wait until your child is relatively calm, but briefly reiterate what he did wrong (""No hitting. Time-out.""), and escort him to a naughty chair. (Many experts advise against sending your child to his room because he'll have toys, books, and other fun things there.) Resist the urge to lecture him. It's okay to offer an explanation before the time-out or after it, but not during it. If you say things like, ""I've told you about this a thousand times,"" ""Now you are paying the price,"" or ""I hope you are thinking about what you did,"" you are giving your child attention rather than removing it—and any attention, even negative attention, can act as a reward rather than a consequence.  Step 3: Start the clock. Dr. Staats originally suggested keeping kids in a time-out until they stopped fussing, even if that took a half-hour. Today, many parents use the ""one minute for every year of a child's age"" rule. However, recent research done by Timothy Vollmer, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, shows that even brief time-outs of one to three minutes are effective, at least for children ages 3 to 5. Setting the clock for longer may make it harder to get your child to sit in a time-out in the future.  Step 4: Make it boring. During the time-out, do not talk to your child or make eye contact. Staying silent may require some practice, especially if your child says things like, ""You are the worst mom in the world!"" or asks questions like, ""Why are you doing this to me?"" and ""Can I have a glass of water?"" No matter what your child says or asks during the time-out, ignore it.  Step 5: When the timer goes off, call an end to the time-out. It doesn't matter if your child is still fidgety, sassy, or crying. Once the timer goes off, the time-out is over, Dr. Vollmer says. How will you know if time-outs are working? If you start following these steps, within one to three weeks you should need to employ them less and less often. Says Dr. Larzelere, ""When you call for a time-out and mean what you say, children will learn to listen.""",https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/discipline/time-out/common-time-out-mistakes-and-how-to-solve-them,"Common Time-Out Mistakes and How to Solve Them 
   The New and Improved Time-Out Technique   
 Step 1: Give one clear warning. The best study found that a single non-repetitive warning before every time-out can reduce the number of time-outs needed by 74 percent, says Dr. Larzelere. If your child doesn't start cooperating within five seconds, proceed with the time-out.  Step 2: Announce a time-out. You might wait until your child is relatively calm, but briefly reiterate what he did wrong (""No hitting. Time-out.""), and escort him to a naughty chair. (Many experts advise against sending your child to his room because he'll have toys, books, and other fun things there.) Resist the urge to lecture him. It's okay to offer an explanation before the time-out or after it, but not during it. If you say things like, ""I've told you about this a thousand times,"" ""Now you are paying the price,"" or ""I hope you are thinking about what you did,"" you are giving your child attention rather than removing it—and any attention, even negative attention, can act as a reward rather than a consequence.  Step 3: Start the clock. Dr. Staats originally suggested keeping kids in a time-out until they stopped fussing, even if that took a half-hour. Today, many parents use the ""one minute for every year of a child's age"" rule. However, recent research done by Timothy Vollmer, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, shows that even brief time-outs of one to three minutes are effective, at least for children ages 3 to 5. Setting the clock for longer may make it harder to get your child to sit in a time-out in the future.  Step 4: Make it boring. During the time-out, do not talk to your child or make eye contact. Staying silent may require some practice, especially if your child says things like, ""You are the worst mom in the world!"" or asks questions like, ""Why are you doing this to me?"" and ""Can I have a glass of water?"" No matter what your child says or asks during the time-out, ignore it.  Step 5: When the timer goes off, call an end to the time-out. It doesn't matter if your child is still fidgety, sassy, or crying. Once the timer goes off, the time-out is over, Dr. Vollmer says. How will you know if time-outs are working? If you start following these steps, within one to three weeks you should need to employ them less and less often. Says Dr. Larzelere, ""When you call for a time-out and mean what you say, children will learn to listen."""

 Temper tantrums can be frustrating for any parent. But instead of looking at them as disasters, treat tantrums as opportunities for education."
154,Temper Tantrums  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,How Can We Avoid Tantrums?,"Temper tantrums range from whining and crying to screaming, kicking, hitting, and breath-holding spells. They're equally common in boys and girls and usually happen between the ages of 1 to 3.  Some kids may have tantrums often, and others have them rarely. Tantrums are a normal part of child development. They're how young children show that they're upset or frustrated.  Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable. They can have a meltdown because they can't have something they want (like a toy or candy) or can’t get someone to do what they want (like getting a parent to pay attention to them immediately or getting a sibling to give up the tablet). Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time.  Tantrums are common during the second year of life, when language skills are developing. Because toddlers can't always say what they want or need, and because words describing feelings are more complicated and develop later, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease.  Toddlers want independence and control over their environment — more than they can actually handle.

155,Temper Tantrums  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,What Should I Do During a Tantrum?,"Try to prevent tantrums from happening in the first place, whenever possible. Here are some ideas that may help:  Give plenty of positive attention. Get in the habit of catching your child being good. Reward your little one with praise and attention for positive behavior. Be specific about praising behaviors you want to see happen more often (such as, “I like the way you said please and waited for your milk” or “Thank you for sharing the blocks with your sister.”)  Try to give toddlers some control over little things. Offer minor choices such as ""Do you want orange juice or apple juice?"" or ""Do you want to brush your teeth before or after taking a bath?"" This way, you aren't asking ""Do you want to brush your teeth now?"" — which of course will be answered ""no."" Allow control when it doesn’t really matter. Instead of struggling over an outfit your child puts on that doesn’t match, for example, consider whether this may be an opportunity to allow self-expression and independence and if it really makes a difference given the day's schedule.  Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach. This makes struggles less likely. Obviously, this isn't always possible, especially outside of the home where the environment can't be controlled.  Distract your child. Try offering something else in place of what they can't have. Start a new activity to replace the frustrating or forbidden one (for example, if your child is jumping on the couch, ask them to come help you “cook” by offering a plastic container and wooden spoon. Then you can praise them for helping or following directions, rather than having them start a tantrum or refuse to get down). Or simply change the environment. Take your toddler outside or inside or move to a different room.  Help kids learn new skills and succeed. Help kids learn to do things. Praise them to help them feel proud of what they can do. Also, start with something simple before moving on to more challenging tasks.  Consider the request carefully when your child wants something. Is it outrageous? Maybe it isn't. Choose your battles. It's even OK to change your mind if you originally said no — but find a way to allow the desired treat as a reward for good behavior.  Know your child's limits. If you know your toddler is tired, it's not the best time to go grocery shopping or try to squeeze in one more errand. Hungry kids are more likely to demand food in the store than children who have just had a meal (just like adults!).",https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tantrums.html#catbehavio,"Temper Tantrums  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth

156,Temper Tantrums  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,What Should I Do After a Tantrum?,"Keep your cool when responding to a tantrum. Don't complicate the problem with your own frustration or anger. Remind yourself that your job is helping your child learn to calm down. So you need to be calm too.  Tantrums should be handled differently depending on why your child is upset. Sometimes, you may need to provide comfort. If your child is tired or hungry, it's time for a nap or a snack. Other times, its best to ignore an outburst or distract your child with a new activity.  If a tantrum is happening to get attention from parents, one of the best ways to reduce this behavior is to ignore it. If a tantrum happens after your child is refused something, stay calm and don't give a lot of explanations for why your child can't have what they want. Move on to another activity with your child.  If a tantrum happens after your child is told to do something they don't want to do, it's best to ignore the tantrum. But be sure that you follow through on having your child complete the task after they're calm.  Kids who are in danger of hurting themselves or others during a tantrum should be taken to a quiet, safe place to calm down. This also applies to tantrums in public places.  If a safety issue is involved and a toddler repeats the forbidden behavior after being told to stop, use a time-out by sitting the child on a designated chair or in the corner for just a few minutes. Be nearby so that you can supervise, but do not interact until they are calm. Be consistent. Don't give in on safety issues.  Preschoolers and older kids are more likely to use tantrums to get their way if they've learned that this behavior works. For school-age kids, it's appropriate to send them to their rooms to cool off while paying little attention to the behavior.  Let your child know that you will tell them when the time-out is over and that the sooner they are calm and quiet, the sooner it will end. This is empowering — kids can affect the outcome by their own actions, and thus gain a sense of control that was lost during the tantrum.  Do not reward your child's tantrum by giving in. This will only prove to your little one that the tantrum was effective.  Consider making a “chill out” or “calm down” spot in your home (some teachers use this in preschool, as well). Use a soft cushion and provide books, a stuffed animal, some soft music, and other calming activities in a place where others won’t disturb the child.

188,3-Day Potty Training Method: How It Works and How to Prepare- Parenting,Speaking of Accidents…," “The parent(s) needs to know that it will take work and you have to dedicate a full three days to the child,” Jensen says. “This means giving up ‘me’ time. You won’t be cooking, cleaning or visiting with friends—or keeping up with the Kardashians.”     And when you’re figuring out how to potty train, she says, you must plan ahead: “Have your shopping done and meals prepared ahead of time. Do the laundry and clean the house prior to starting. Be ready to play games, color, watch cartoons and just enjoy some bonding time with your child.”     It’s not a bad idea to arrange playdates out of the home for older kids, too. Make this three-day potty-training mission about your soon-to-be potty pro.     Pick up a few T-shirts that will cover your kid’s private area. Why? Your child will be going commando for three days. The theory is that if they know the diaper isn’t there to catch the pee or poop, it should click that they need to get their bare butt to a potty.     “We do not put pants on the child during the training process because we want to be able to see when they have an accident,” she says.     Stock up on drinks, too, because you’re going to encourage your kid to drink more than usual. This will obviously cause your kid to have to pee, and that’s what you want when potty training as they learn to recognize that feeling.     Hit up the local dollar store for potty- training incentives—stickers, crayons, coloring books and action heroes. Stay strong and remember prizes are for peeing in the toilet, not on the rug or all over themselves.

191,3-Day Potty Training Method: How It Works and How to Prepare- Parenting,3 Day Potty Training by Lora Jensen," When your child wakes up in the morning, take off their soggy diaper and bid it farewell. Have your kid throw the diaper out and say “bye-bye.”  Dress them in an oversized T-shirt and/or big kid underwear and explain there is no diaper to catch the pee-pee or poop, so they have to put it in the potty.  Give your kid breakfast and an extra drink. Afterwards, lead your little one to the potty. It should be a successful trip after all those liquids.  Go on with the day, but remember, no leaving the house during the three-day potty training. Play, read, color, and watch cartoons.  Have a sippy cup of water in your kid’s reach at all times. Just like crate-training a puppy, walk your child to the potty every 15 minutes, all day long, for three days.  Cut off all liquids and snacks after dinner while potty training.  Complete one final potty mission before bed.  Wake your kid up halfway through the night to pee. (Yes, set an alarm.)  Repeat for the next two days.  Don’t get upset about potty-training accidents.

208,Communication Strategies for Parents of Children with ADHD - Child Development Institute,About The Author,"   Parenting a child with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a challenge. Communication is essential and communicating with a child who has attention or sensory challenges can be difficult. Below are strategies for strengthening communication with your child.  Recognize when your child is actually hearing you and paying attention. Most people require eye contact to know that they’re being heard. However, a child with ADD or ADHD has a mind that is operating at a fast pace. They may not be able to make or maintain eye contact with you. This doesn’t mean that they’re not listening. On the contrary, many children fidget with objects when they’re listening. Pay attention to your child’s cues.  Give them short and simple directions. Children are easily overwhelmed. When you’re teaching them something or asking them to perform a task, give them step-by-step instructions. However, don’t lay out all the steps at once. Give them one or two simple steps and then move on once each step is completed.  Create communication strategies. You may need to get creative when trying to communicate with your child. For example, introduce a ‘listening ball.’ Instruct your child to hold the ball or toss it from hand to hand while they listen to you. You can also use visual cues to indicate what you want or need your child to do. When it’s time for bed, show them a picture of a bed or give them the stuffed animal that they sleep with.  Give them choices. Children learn to quickly tune their parents out, especially when they perceive that you’re talking at them rather than to them. However, when you give your child a choice, it’s easier for them to listen. They often allow themselves to slow down and weigh the choices so that they can make the most appealing decision. For example, when it’s time for bed you might say, “It’s time for bed. Which pajamas do you want to wear tonight – the red ones or the blue ones?”  Related: Parenting Your ADHD Child – Strategies That Work!  Use visual aids. Children with ADD and ADHD respond to visual aids. Instead of telling them what they need to do to get ready for bed, create a poster with a series of pictures demonstrating the steps.  Talk softly and remain calm. As you become agitated or raise your voice, it can stimulate your child. This is the opposite of what you’re trying to accomplish, especially if they’re already agitated or upset. Speak quietly to your child and remain calm. If they’re throwing a tantrum or are agitated, step away and engage in a quiet activity that they may find interesting. Build a tower with blocks, color, or work on a puzzle. Your calm can and will influence them.  Explain your expectations. When your child knows what is expected of them and what they can expect, they tend to behave better. Rewarding positive behavior also supports future cooperation.  Raising a child with ADD or ADHD requires some creative parenting. Learn your child’s cues and triggers. Observe their learning style and support that style in your communication. If you’re struggling, join a support group. Sometimes talking to other parents can help you not only cope but you can also pick up some new tips.",https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/parenting/communication-strategies-parents-children-adhd,"Communication Strategies for Parents of Children with ADHD - Child Development Institute

209,How to Manage Encopresis in Children - ChildrensMD,Alex Maixner,"Encopresis is a frustrating experience for children, parents, and teachers. Encopresis is generally defined as the passage of feces in inappropriate places, like underwear or the floor, by children who are past the age of toilet training. A variety of different factors can contribute to encopresis, including both physical and behavioral factors. This is why it is essential to involve both medical and behavioral health clinicians in the treatment of encopresis.  One common physical contributing factor for encopresis is constipation, which may lead to overflow bowel incontinence (stool leakage).  Behavioral factors can also contribute to constipation, and in turn encopresis. These include ignoring physical cues associated with passing stool as well as voluntary withholding of bowels. For example, a child may have had a particularly painful bowel movement. Then the child may voluntarily withhold their stool for fear of experiencing pain.  Although constipation may contribute to encopresis, it is important to note that not all children with encopresis will have constipation.",https://childrensmd.org/browse-by-topic/behavior-development/manage-encopresis-children,"How to Manage Encopresis in Children - ChildrensMD

210,How to Manage Encopresis in Children - ChildrensMD,"Behavior & Development • Jun 25, 2019","First, it’s important for the family to work closely with a medical provider to identify any medical reason for encopresis, such as constipation. The provider can then implement a bowel cleanout if appropriate.  If a bowel cleanout is appropriate, it is important this occurs prior to the implementation of behavioral techniques. Once the child has completed the bowel cleanout, the following interventions may be helpful:  Increase your child’s awareness of their physical cues associated with passing stool. Parents may need to point out to their children when they are demonstrating physical signs that they need to use the restroom like “the potty dance.”  Implement scheduled sitting – regular times each day that the child will sit on the toilet. To encourage sitting on the toilet, parents can give the child a special toy or electronic device that can only be used on the toilet.  Parents should provide praise for sitting on the toilet regardless of whether or not the child passed a bowel movement while sitting. For example, “I like how you sat on the toilet,” or “I’m really glad that you tried.”  Encourage your child to implement deep breathing to help them relax on the toilet.  If your child has an accident in between scheduled sitting times, remain calm and encourage your child to clean up.  Implementing a reward system may also be helpful.

 Behavior & Development • Jun 25, 2019 
 First, it’s important for the family to work closely with a medical provider to identify any medical reason for encopresis, such as constipation. The provider can then implement a bowel cleanout if appropriate.  If a bowel cleanout is appropriate, it is important this occurs prior to the implementation of behavioral techniques. Once the child has completed the bowel cleanout, the following interventions may be helpful:  Increase your child’s awareness of their physical cues associated with passing stool. Parents may need to point out to their children when they are demonstrating physical signs that they need to use the restroom like “the potty dance.”  Implement scheduled sitting – regular times each day that the child will sit on the toilet. To encourage sitting on the toilet, parents can give the child a special toy or electronic device that can only be used on the toilet.  Parents should provide praise for sitting on the toilet regardless of whether or not the child passed a bowel movement while sitting. For example, “I like how you sat on the toilet,” or “I’m really glad that you tried.”  Encourage your child to implement deep breathing to help them relax on the toilet.  If your child has an accident in between scheduled sitting times, remain calm and encourage your child to clean up.  Implementing a reward system may also be helpful.  If interested in receiving support from a behavioral health specialist in terms of implementation of behavioral interventions, please contact your pediatrician or call 454-TEEN (8336) for referrals.

224,Kids and Sleep  (for Parents) - Nemours KidsHealth,How Much Sleep Do Kids Need?,"As we sleep, our brains move between two types of sleep — non-REM and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Together, the stages of non-REM sleep and REM sleep make up a sleep cycle. Babies spend more time in REM sleep and their sleep cycles are shorter than adults. Time spent in REM sleep decreases and sleep cycles get longer as kids get older. By the time kids start school, one complete sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes, which is similar to an adult's.  Stage 1 and stage 2 non-REM sleep are light sleep stages:  A person can wake up easily.  Eye movements slow down, heart and breathing rates slow down, and body temperature decreases.  Stage 3 non-REM sleep is deep sleep:  It's harder to wake someone up. When awakened, a person often will feel groggy and confused.  Night terrors, sleepwalking, and bed-wetting can happen during this stage.  This is the most refreshing sleep stage. It’s during this stage that the body releases hormones needed for growth and development.  In the final, REM stage of the sleep cycle:  The eyes move quickly under the eyelids, breathing gets faster, and the heart beats faster. You can’t move your arms or legs during REM sleep.

If your child's anxiety means going to school in the morning is very stressful, allow plenty of extra time.

337,Stop Children From Biting: Strategies and Tips for Parents, How to Stop Your Child From Biting ,"Kids bite for a number of reasons -- and most of them aren't intentionally malicious.  They're in pain. When babies bite, typically it's because they're teething. They're just doing it to relieve the pain of their swollen, tender gums.  They're exploring their world. Very young children use their mouths to explore, just as they use their hands. Just about everything infants or toddlers pick up eventually winds up in their mouths. Kids this age aren't yet able to prevent themselves from biting the object of their interest.  They're looking for a reaction. Part of exploration is curiosity. Toddlers experiment to see what kind of reaction their actions will provoke. They'll bite down on a friend or sibling to hear the surprised exclamation, not realizing how painful the experience is for that person.  They're craving attention. In older kids, biting is just one of several bad behaviors used to get attention. When a child feels ignored, discipline is at least one way of getting noticed -- even if the attention is negative rather than positive.  They're frustrated. Biting, like hitting, is a way for some children to assert themselves when they're still too young to express feelings effectively through words. To your child, biting is a way to get back a favorite toy, tell you that they are unhappy, or let another child know that they want to be left alone.

338,Stop Children From Biting: Strategies and Tips for Parents, In this Article ,"Practice prevention so that your child will be less likely to bite in the first place.  If your baby is teething, make sure to always have a cool teething ring or washcloth on hand so they will be less likely to sink teeth into someone's arm.  Avoid situations in which your child can get irritable enough to bite. Make sure that all of your child's needs -- including eating and nap time -- are taken care of before you go out to play. Bring along a snack to soothe your child if they get cranky from being hungry.  As soon as your child is old enough, encourage the use of words (""I'm angry with you"" or ""That's my toy"") instead of biting. Other ways to express frustration or anger include hugging a stuffed animal or punching a pillow. Sometimes, shortening activities or giving your child a break can help prevent the rising frustration that can lead to biting and other bad behaviors.  Give your child enough of your time throughout the day (for example, by reading or playing together), so they don't bite just to get attention. Extra attention is especially important when your child is going through a major life change, such as a move or welcoming a baby sibling. If your child is prone to biting, keep an eye on any playmates and step in when an altercation appears to be brewing.  Even with your best prevention efforts, biting incidents might still occur. When your child bites, firmly let your child know that this behavior is not acceptable by saying, ""No. We don't bite!"" Explain that biting hurts the other person. Then remove your child from the situation and give the child time to calm down.  You might have heard from other parents that if your child bites you, bite your child back. This isn't good advice. Children learn by imitation. If you bite your child, the child is going to get the impression that this behavior is acceptable and they will be more likely to do it again. The same goes for hitting a child for biting.  If you are unable to get your child to stop biting, the behavior could begin to have an impact on school and relationships. You or another adult might have to closely supervise interactions between your child and other kids. When biting becomes a habit or continues past age 4 or 5, it might stem from a more serious emotional problem. Talk to your child's health care provider, or enlist the help of a child psychologist or therapist.",https://www.webmd.com/parenting/stop-children-from-biting#,"Stop Children From Biting: Strategies and Tips for Parents

409,Why is my Toddler Suddenly a Picky Eater? - Motherly,Toddler Nutrition,"If you have a picky toddler, you are not alone. The reasons for this sudden food aversion are both simple and complex:  They’re becoming more independent. Now that your child has started walking and is beginning to speak, they are developing a sense of independence and have the consciousness to act upon it. Whether your child likes a particular food or not, they can refuse to open their mouth, run away, cry in protest, throw a tantrum or do all of the above.  They’re becoming more intuitive. Toddlers can begin to notice a pattern with eating: most “good” foods are sweet and most unsweet foods are green. The vast majority of baby food products combine vegetables with sweet foods like apples, bananas or pears. A baby who has grown accustomed to eating such products develops a palate for sweet foods. When attempting to introduce a non-sweet green vegetable, that toddler will inevitably notice the difference and refuse it. Parents also tend to impose their own food hang-ups on children. For example, parents who do not like okra or brown rice do not cook those foods for themselves and therefore do not give them to their children. It’s important for parents to remember that eating is a learned behavior beginning with the very first spoonful and reinforced with each and every meal.  They’re learning what they do and don’t like. Your child may not be a fan of certain textures. Because eating is as much about tactile sensation as it is about taste, your child may not like foods that are too crunchy, slimy, soft, grainy, chewy and so on. If this is the case then your child’s pickiness should be consistent across different flavors. For example, if they don’t like crunchy foods, they’ll refuse a sweet, juicy crisp green apple as quickly as they’d turn down fresh, crisp celery. The problem is not the pickiness but rather the way that pickiness is managed.",https://www.mother.ly/toddler/toddler-nutrition/why-is-my-toddler-a-picky-eater,"Why is my Toddler Suddenly a Picky Eater? - Motherly

410,Why is my Toddler Suddenly a Picky Eater? - Motherly,Food,"1. Don’t stop trying to introduce new foods too soon.  Many parents aren’t aware of the lengthy yet normal course of food acceptance in children. A 2004 study published in the Journal of the American Diet Association revealed that 25% of mothers with toddlers offered foods only once or twice before deciding if the child liked it. Approximately half of mothers made similar judgments after serving new foods only three to five times.  Touching, smelling, playing with and spitting out food are all normal exploratory behaviors that happen before acceptance—and some kids simply take longer to try new food and develop a taste or affinity for it. Keep trying and eventually, your child will come around. Be consistent, don’t give up and remember, this stage in your child’s life is critical as the foods they eat now are key building blocks for healthy growth and development.  2. Bring home the food items you want your child to eat.  Your child can only be as picky as the food options that are made available to them. If you want them to eat more healthful foods, fill your refrigerator and pantry with what you believe are healthy, nutritious food options. You can also make life easy for yourself by stocking your freezer with convenient foods that don’t skimp on taste and nutrition.  3. Expose kids to all varieties of foods.  Introduce your child to an array of food flavors and textures no matter what your own personal preferences or aversions may be. Your child may very well love some of the foods you dislike.  4. Don’t provide too many food options.  Often parents of multiple children will make a variety of dishes for a meal in order to appease each child’s individual tastes. This kind of short-order cooking habit is tiring, unsustainable and only serves to foster the habit you are trying to correct. There’s no reason for any child to stop being picky if other options are always readily available. Unless your child has an allergy or sensory issue, then they should learn to try whatever you serve.  5. Don’t supplement missed meals with junk.  Every parent living with a toddler understands the practice of “picking one’s battles” but setting up healthy nutrition practices is a battle that should be fought to win. If your child refuses to eat a meal because they don’t like the options available, try not to give your child junk food just to fill their belly. In time, those empty calories can become lifelong unhealthy choices. Your child depends on you to choose a balanced diet that is developmentally appropriate and fuels good health and happiness.  6. Treat every meal and snack time as an opportunity to nourish your child with good food.  Instead of viewing snack time as “treat” time, consider snack time a mini meal and feed your child accordingly. Again, give your child every opportunity to get acquainted with new foods. Avoid crackers and other convenience foods and try giving your child sliced carrots or bell peppers instead.  7. Make every eating experience enjoyable.  As many studies have shown, children who help with meal preparation are more likely to eat food they helped make, so let your child pitch in! Make cooking each meal a family activity by allowing your child to help. This is a great way to show your child that delicious food and healthy food aren’t mutually exclusive. Prepare foods in their most delicious and visually-appealing form and be sure to take into account your child’s texture preferences. For example, don’t overcook string beans for a child who likes their veggies firm.  8. Don’t force a “clean plate.”  While you may be anxious about your child getting the necessary nutrients they need for growth and development, avoid forcing them to eat every bite you serve. Your child is not trying to frustrate you, they’re simply learning as everything is still new and different to them.  Remember that for many kids, food acceptance takes time and this important stage in your toddler’s life is absolutely normal. Also, forcing them to clean their plate causes a child to lose their natural sense of knowing when they are full, which can lead to overeating. Building healthy eating habits means respecting when your child is full even when you may think they’ve not had enough. After all, you can always serve any leftovers as a mini meal for snack time.",https://www.mother.ly/toddler/toddler-nutrition/why-is-my-toddler-a-picky-eater,"Why is my Toddler Suddenly a Picky Eater? - Motherly

420,Easy Ways to Help a Picky Eater Get Nutrition - Motherly,Child Nutrition,"A new study conducted by the CDC found that  babies and toddlers are getting way too much added sugar  . High sugar intake in toddlers and babies could be influencing their food preferences, and setting them up for future bad eating habits, the research explains. Sugar is not just empty calories, eating high sugar diets can also increase the risk of weight gain and even increase the risk of disease later in life.  Sweet foods and sugary drinks can cause blood sugar to spike then crash, which can contribute to toddler meltdowns. To choose foods that will provide lasting energy for your toddler, I recommend avoiding sweetened drinks and following my “Rule of Three” for eating: make sure that each meal or snack contains at least one of the following blood-sugar leveling macronutrients:  Healthy fats (found in nuts, seeds, avocado, and full-fat organic dairy products like cheese and yogurt)  Fiber (sources include whole fruit and veggies, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds  Protein (Good animal-based sources include meat, dairy and eggs, while good plant-based sources include nuts, seeds, legumes, hemp, chia and quinoa).  Naturally sweet whole fruits come paired with vitamins, minerals and fiber, making them a better choice for toddlers than a sugary snack or drink that is just empty calories.  As a former picky eater myself, and the mom of a reformed picky eater, I know the struggle is real when it comes to picky eating, and that there is no “quick fix.” Just take it one day at a time, keep encouraging them, and avoid the power struggles!

When my husband went out of town, however, I fiercely protected my bed.   Some might call this selfish; I call it setting healthy boundaries for myself. I knew that I needed sleep to be an engaged mother the next day. I knew that I needed those precious few hours of “alone time” to recharge. And in those early days of motherhood when I was constantly touched out, I needed the physical space.   Just because we are mothers doesn’t mean we can’t have boundaries, especially when those boundaries help us be the good moms that we want to be, the good moms that we know we are.   Quite simply, setting this motherhood boundary made me a better mom.  I didn’t really think much of it, but over time, I’ve realized just how strange it is that I have never co-slept with my kids. When I heard about moms who loved snuggling up with their toddlers, I wondered if something was wrong with me.

Just because we are mothers doesn’t mean we can’t have boundaries, especially when those boundaries help us be the good moms that we want to be, the good moms that we know we are.   It was never really about sleeping with my kids; it was about boundaries and telling that pesky mom guilt to take a hike.

Parents and caregivers should be involved in their child’s bedtime routines, keeping them as consistent as possible night after night.

Don’t battle their behavior nor increase separation through discipline.,"Why is separation so difficult and why does it produce so much anxiety? Until approximately six years of age, young children are not fully developed as separate beings. They are highly dependent on others for caretaking, and staying close is one of the brain’s biggest preoccupations. In the 1950s, a British psychologist named John Bowlby coined the term attachment and said a child’s mental health was based on a satisfying and enjoyable relationship with a parent, that is both warm and continuous. Children aren’t meant to enjoy separation, it is nature’s design.  While there is nothing wrong with a young child who misses their parent, it can be unsettling to both parties.  Young children can be full of frustration, tantrums, resistance, and opposition in the face of separation. Alarm in a child often arises at nighttime, accumulated from the day and activated by the point of separation that sleep represents.  From a parent’s perspective, it can help to remember that if our children didn’t want us close, we wouldn’t be able to take care of them. Being attached is the superglue that binds us to each other and provides a sense of home, comfort, and belonging. Attachment is the doorway through which missing and separation anxiety enter.  Toddlers and preschoolers also come with shyness instincts that make them fickle when it comes to receiving care from others. This is the result of healthy brain development by six months of age, where a child zeros-in on one primary caretaker. At this time the child will begin to display stranger protest towards others and show a clear preference towards whom they want to be close. The instinct to shy away from strangers is nature’s way of ensuring they follow the people who are responsible for caring for them.  If children are meant to miss their parents and shy away from substitute caregivers, then how can we for care them given the separations that come with everyday life?",https://www.mother.ly/toddler/toddler-milestones/stranger-separation-anxiety-your-toddler-5-tips-to-better-attachment,"How To Ease your Toddler’s Separation Anxiety - Motherly
